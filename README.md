Ive created an app for a history subject called "The World History APP!" where students across the world can use and broaden their history worldwide.
The app uses flashcards to ask questions about the history of the world, making it both fun and easy to use and helps student widen their knowledge on history.
The app has a timer for each question to help train the student for class tests and exam settings ,to be able to stay punctual and work time effectively.
Ive used both text view and button for the interface.
The user must press on the clickme button so the game can proceed to giving questions and on the later stage scores.
When the user is done with the questions the final score will be given at the end and an option to try again if the scores are too low.
